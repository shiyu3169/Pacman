Comparing BFS and A* Algorithms:
    BFS
    BFS will look at a lot more nodes than A* will, which makes it much slower.
    Also, BFS will keep pushing all neibours of current node into queque, which uses more space to store them.

    Time complexity: O(|E|)=O(b^d)
    Space complexity:O(|V|)=O(b^d)

    AStar
    AStar uses the following function
    cost = d(s,c) + h(c)
    where s is the source node, c is the node currently expanded and h(c) is the estimation of the cost to reach from c to the destination pill.
    In this game, we use manhattan heuristic as an estimate. Given two nodes (r,c) and (r1,c1). The manhattan heuristic is the manhattan distance between the two nodes and is given by
    |r1 - r | + |c1 - c|

    TIme complexity: O(|E|)=O(b^d)
    Space complexity: O(|V|)=O(b^{d})
